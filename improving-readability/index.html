        One of the first design tasks I was assigned for the Atlas design team
        was to design a breadcrumb component. The design process I followed
        while implementing this component consisted of two phases,
        <strong>discovery</strong> and <strong>design</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="heading-breadcrumb">Breadcrumb Component Task</h2>
      <p>
        The component I was tasked with to design was a breadcrumb component.
        The breadcrumb is a <strong>compact navigation system</strong> used to
        show a user’s location within the site’s hierarchy.
      </p>
      <h2 id="heading-discovery">Discovery Phase</h2>
      <p>
        During the discovery phase I explored the best practices for the
        component including its functionality and accessibility. I explored
        Nielson Norman Group and Designing for web accessibility W3 to note down
        the best practices. I used a
        <a
          href="https://atlas.travelport.com/235fac9ab/v/0/p/348ded-breadcrumb--new"
          >Figma file</a
        >
        to store my design process during the discovery phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        I visited other design systems to see how they approach the breadcrumb
        component. The design systems I approached were
        <a
          href="https://atlas.travelport.com/235fac9ab/v/0/p/348ded-breadcrumb--new"
          >Atlassian</a
        >,
        <a
          href="https://atlas.travelport.com/235fac9ab/v/0/p/348ded-breadcrumb--new"
          >Ant</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://atlas.travelport.com/235fac9ab/v/0/p/348ded-breadcrumb--new"
          >Carbon</a
        >. I made note of all the <strong>common patterns</strong> these design
        systems use for their breadcrumb component. Keeping the developers in
        mind, I took note of the props each design system used in their
        breadcrumb component because after completing my design for the
        breadcrumb, I need to provide developer specifications to the Atlas
        developers.
      </p>
      <h2 id="heading-design">Design Phase</h2>
      <p>
        After a few hard working hours in Figma I successfully created the
        breadcrumb component. With all of the research I gathered, I combined
        them into one final design solution. The component consists of a maximum
        of eight breadcrumb items that are <strong>separated</strong> using the
        ">" symbol. Each breadcrumb item is a link except the current page
        breadcrumb.
      </p>
      <p>
        To implement this component, I reused the Atlas link component and added
        it to the breadcrumb component along with the separators. Re-using the
        link component and adding it to be a piece of the breadcrumb component
        reminded of a great quote said by Drew Bridewell:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "A design system acts as the connective tissue that holds together
          your entire platform".
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Designing the component in the Travelport's Figma file create what is
        known as a <strong>single source of truth</strong>. This means that when
        other designer want to use the breadcrumb component in their own
        wireframes they can do so without "breaking" the component. Atlas has
        control over the source of truth breadcrumb component and, therefore, if
        any design changes need to be made for the component, an Atlas designer
        like me can come in and edit the source of truth component. The
        breadcrumb component the other designers use which is can be seen as the
        "child" of the source of truth component (parent), will
        <strong>inherit</strong> any changes made to its parent. This does not
        cause any interuption to the designers using the component, it simply
        updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the Atlas documentation site, I wrote the full documentation for the
        breadcrumb component and it can be viewed
        <a
          href="https://atlas.travelport.com/235fac9ab/v/0/p/348ded-breadcrumb--new"
          >here</a
        >. In this documentation I highlight the overview of the component, some
        do's and dont's, and a list of the usage guidelines.
